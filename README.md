## Decription

There are two analysis for this project, WeatherPy and VacationPy.  
WeatherPy takes a random sample of roughly 500 cities throughout the 
world and looks at the relationship between their latitude and various
weather factors such as temp, humidity, and cloudiness.  Lingear regression
analysis is performed to see if there is any relationship between latitude and
those other weather factors.

VacationPy takes that list of 500 cities and plots it on a map.  I then narrowed
down the list of cities to those with more favorable weather conditions.  Finally,
we used the places API to find the closest hotel to each city.

## Instructions

You will need to ensure that you have installed the GeoViews and Citipy libraries and signed up for the GeoApify API service.
